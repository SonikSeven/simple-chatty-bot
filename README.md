# Simple Chatty Bot

This GitHub project houses a simple Python chat bot that engages users with a friendly conversation, can guess their age, counts to a number they provide, and offers a simple programming awareness test.

## Description

The chat bot, named "Aid", greets the user, asks for their name, guesses their age based on a small maths game, count to any number the user requests, checks the user's basic programming knowledge through a multiple-choice question, and bids them farewell on completion of the interactions.

## Features

- **Greeting**: Initiates the conversation with a greeting and introduction of itself.
- **Name Remembering**: Asks the user for their name and compliments it.
- **Age Guessing**: Guesses the user's age based on remainders of their age when divided by 3, 5, and 7.
- **Counting**: Demonstrates its ability to count to any number specified by the user.
- **Knowledge Test**: Presents a single question to assess the user’s basic understanding of programming.
- **Conclusion**: Congratulates the user after successfully answering the programming question.
